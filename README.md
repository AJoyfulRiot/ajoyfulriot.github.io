# A Joyful Riot Design Guide

A Joyful Riot provides tutorials, printables, and party ideas geared toward forming wonderful memories with your loved ones.

This Design Guide is an open-source resource that we use for our site. The Guide includes our design principles, guidelines for user experience and visual identity standards. The Guide will continue to evolve as we learn what works best for AJR.
